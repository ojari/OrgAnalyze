* ParserOrg

Convert org-mode file to python objects for further processing

The parser processes the following org-mode elements, turning them into specific Python objects:

- *Headers*: Lines starting with `*`, `**`, etc. are parsed as `OrgHeader` objects.
- *Clock Entries*: Lines starting with `CLOCK:` or `#+CLK:` are parsed as `OrgClock` objects.
- *Tables*: Blocks of lines starting with `|` are parsed into `OrgTable` objects.

  | Name | Value |
  |------+-------|
  | One  |     1 |
  | Two  |     2 |

- *Source Blocks*: Code blocks delimited by `#+BEGIN_SRC` and `#+END_SRC` are parsed as `OrgSourceBlock`.

#+begin_src python
for i in range(1,10):
    print(f"Number is {i}")
#+end_src

- *Math Blocks*: LaTeX math blocks delimited by `\ [` and `\ ]` are parsed as `OrgMath`.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
\]

- *Property Drawers*: Blocks delimited by `:PROPERTIES:` and `:END:` are parsed as `OrgProperties`.
- *File Variables*: Lines like `#+TITLE: My Document` are parsed and stored in the parser's `vars` dictionary.
- *Lists*: Lines starting with `-`, `+`, or numbered lists are parsed as `OrgList` objects.
- *Text and Links*: All other lines are treated as plain text (`OrgText`), with org-mode links like [ [ ... ] ] being processed.
